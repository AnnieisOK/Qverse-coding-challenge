## Eingesetzte Technologien / Frameworks

For the Meme Generator I used the following technologies / languages :

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript 

I chose these languages as they are the ones that I master the best and believe that they were powerful enough to help me deliver the results I wanted.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I decided to use vanilla languages because, as stated above, I am more confident at the moment with these technologies.
Moreover, a web app of this level of complexity was easy to create without the use of 3rd party libraries.
I have, however included a Google Fonts CDN in my project in order to style the page as desired.

## Installation / Run


No specific components need to be installed locally.
